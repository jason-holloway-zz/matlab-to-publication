Produce publication quality plots from MATLAB figures

Open [LatexWriteup/plottingInLatex.pdf](https://github.com/jason-holloway/matlab-to-publication/blob/master/LatexWriteup/plottingInLaTeX.pdf) for the overview of my process to produce vector graphics ready for publication in scientific articles. This is still a work in progress, the tutorial section is still to be written.
